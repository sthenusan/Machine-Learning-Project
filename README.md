### Pump It Up: Data Mining the Water Table

**CS 4622 -Machine Learning Individual Project**

**Project Data Source: DrivenData**

**Goal: To predict the operating condition of waterpoints in Tanzania i.e. to determine whether the water pump is functional, non-functional or needs repair
using machine learning technics.** 

**Introduction of the problem**

Currently, the Tanzanian population has very poor access to safe drinking water. 
Approximately 47% of its citizens do not have access to it. More than $ 1.4 million in foreign aid
has been donated to the country in an attempt to help solve the freshwater crisis. On the other hand,
the government of Tanzania is not putting a solution to this problem. A good proportion of the water pumps
are either not working or barely working and are in need of repair. Many people must drink dirty water or
walk several miles just to get to the nearest working groundwater pump.

**Main Objective of the project**

Using the data uploaded to the Taarifa website and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, The goal is to predict which pumps are working,
which are not, and which are in need of repair. Understanding which ones will fail is important for the following reasons:

    Predicting the functionality of all groundwater pumps found in the territory with accurate models could help save 
    the Tanzanian government a lot of time and money. These models can help reduce the cost of inspecting each water pump.
    The government can use this study to find out exactly what the pumping situation of its water is.
    This work will be divided into three parts: 
      1. Exploratory Analysis of the Data
      2. Pre-processing of the same Data
      3. Selection of the Model and traing the model for prediction.
